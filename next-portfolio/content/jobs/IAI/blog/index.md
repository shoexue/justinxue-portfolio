During my time at the Intelligent Adaptive Interventions Lab, I had the opportunity to work on the ABScribe project, which aims to make A/B testing more accessible and intuitive for researchers and practitioners. Here's a deeper dive into my contributions and learnings:

The Challenge:
The original ABScribe interface, while functional, needed a more modern and user-friendly design. Additionally, we wanted to incorporate AI-powered features to help users create more effective A/B tests.

My Contributions:

1. UI/UX Redesign
- Completely revamped the home page using React and Tailwind CSS
- Implemented responsive design principles to ensure seamless experience across devices
- Created an intuitive navigation flow based on user feedback

2. AI Integration
- Worked on integrating GPT-4 to generate personalized persuasive messages
- Developed a system to analyze test results and provide AI-powered recommendations
- Implemented safeguards to ensure AI suggestions align with best practices

Technical Implementation:
- Used React for component-based architecture
- Implemented Tailwind CSS for efficient styling
- Integrated Python backend for AI processing
- Ensured proper error handling and edge cases

Key Learnings:
- Gained deep understanding of A/B testing methodologies
- Improved full-stack development skills
- Learned to work with AI APIs effectively
- Enhanced collaboration skills working with PhD researchers

The project is ongoing, and I'm excited to continue contributing to making A/B testing more accessible to everyone.
