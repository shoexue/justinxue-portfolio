# What's up!

I'm a student at the [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) with a Computer Science - Artifical Intellgence Major.

## A bit about me:

- I'm currently working on the API Foundations team as an SDE intern at Shopify, helping to improve its [public GraphQL API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql)!
- On the side I organize this hackathon with other students [Hackthe6ix] (https://hackthe6ix.com/), Toronto's largest summer hackathon!
- I play volleyball, I play the setter position at school :D
- I also do photography for the McGill Chinese Student Society!
- My favourite drink is milk
