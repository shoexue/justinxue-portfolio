# What's up!

I'm a student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) with a Computer Science Specialist and Mathematics Major.

## A bit about me:

- I'm currently working on the [SCOT](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) Forecasting team as an SDE intern at Amazon!
- I'm interested in a lot of topics such as AI Agents, NLP, and HCI!
- I love coffee (I've been to nearly 100 coffee shops in Toronto).
- I'm also an avid reader. My favourite authors are Donna Tartt and Elif Shafak!
