Tired of waiting in long lines at hackathons? So were we.
After spending hours in queues for registration and food at two different events, we realized there had to be a better way. Thatâ€™s why we built CloudQ â€” a decentralized, on-chain solution for managing virtual lineups. Inspired by the ease of tools like LettuceMeet and McDonaldâ€™s kiosks, CloudQ lets users create and join queues in just a few clicks, saving time, space, and hassle for both organizers and attendees.

ðŸ¥‡ Won Best use of Midnight @McHacks 12!
