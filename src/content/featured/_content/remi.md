As a new band, we struggled to isolate instruments and follow chords while practicing songs. So, we built Melodica â€” a web app that separates any track into individual instruments, visualizes chords, and lets users adjust or download each part. With just a few clicks, Melodica helps musicians practice smarter and play with confidence.
