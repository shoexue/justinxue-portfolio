What's up!

I'm a student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) with a Computer Science Specialist and Mathematics Major.

A bit about me:

- I was previously working as a Software Development Student at [Blackberry QNX](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en).
- I'm currently working as a Software Engineer intern on the AI/ML team at [Seismic](https://seismic.com/).
- I'm interested in a lot of topics in Human-Computer interaction, namely the intersection of LLMs and Education.
- I love coffee (I've been to nearly 100 coffee shops in Toronto).
- I'm also an avid reader. My favourite authors are Donna Tartt and Elif Shafak!
