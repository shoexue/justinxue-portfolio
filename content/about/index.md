What's up! Alvina here!

I'm a student at the [University of Toronto]() with a Computer Science Specialist and Mathematics Major.

I'm also currently working as a Software Development Student at [Blackberry QNX]()! I'm fascinated by a lot of topics in Human-Computer interaction, namely the intersection of LLMs and Education. When I'm not working you can probably find me exploring local coffee shops or reading far, far, far too many books (My favourite author is Haruki Murakami).
