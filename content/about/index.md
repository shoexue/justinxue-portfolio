What's up!

I'm a student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) with a Computer Science Specialist and Mathematics Major.

I'll make this short and sweet:

- I'm currently working as a Software Development Student at [Blackberry QNX](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en).
- I'm also working on the [ABScribe](https://abtestingtools-frontend.up.railway.app/) project at the [Intelligent Adaptive Interventions Lab](https://www.josephjaywilliams.com/home) (you can [read the paper](https://tiny.cc/abscribepaper) here)!
- I'm interested in a lot of topics in Human-Computer interaction, namely the intersection of LLMs and Education.
- I love coffee (I've been to 60+ coffee shops in Toronto).
- I read way too many books. Before you ask, Haruki Murakami is my favourite author.
