Worked in a team of 4 tool with a web-based application connected to an answering machine. It's purpose is to use reminiscence therapy to strengthen bonds between patients with memory-related challenges and their loved ones. After entering patient information and your favourite memory, we make a call to the Cohere API to generate a story which can be played on the answering machine in the specified family member's voice. First place winner of UofTHacks, RBC category.
